	abstract = {Living organisms have different sensitivities to toxicants. This variability can be represented by constructing a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) curve, whereby the toxicity of a substance to a group of species is described by a statistical distribution. Building the SSD curve allows calculating the Hazard Concentration 5\% (HC5), that is, the concentration at which 5\% of the considered species are affected. The HC5 is widely used as an environmental quality criterion and a tool for ecological risk assessment (Posthuma, Suter II, \& Traas, 2001).},
